Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.
Your project is now marked as complete. You can continue working on it, of course, if you think of other ways to improve it. Keep practicing!

/* What does the app's SQL look like? */
CREATE table game (name text,age integer,email text,phonenumber INTEGER);

INSERT into game values("nayana",24,"nayan@land.com",0123456700);
INSERT into game values("suga",20,"sugar@kworld.com",0123456119);
INSERT into game values("virat",26,"virat@fab.com",0127756789);
INSERT into game values("miniso",25,"min@gmail.com",0123456559);

SELECT * from game;

update game SET name = "sahan" where age=24;
select * from game;
 
delete from game where name = "virat";
SELECT * from game;
